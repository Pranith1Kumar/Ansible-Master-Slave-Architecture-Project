# Ansible-Master-Slave-Architecture-Project
Implemented an Ansible master-slave architecture on AWS EC2 instances. Configured one master and one slave instance, enabling secure SSH access by generating RSA keys and adding the masterâ€™s public key to the slave's authorized keys. This setup allows the master to manage the slave instance efficiently.
